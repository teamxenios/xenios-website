DIRTY-WORK INSTRUCTION FOR THIS WINDOW:
Your worktree carries DIRTY canonical-order scaffolding (server/research/orders/canonical-order.ts, order-number.ts, shared contract) that MATCHES this lane. Checkpoint it FIRST, then build the conversion: XRR request -> quote (EXTEND the committed unmounted engine at server/research/assisted-order/quote/** - do NOT invent a second quote system) -> acceptance -> manual payment states -> idempotent canonical order carrying immutable sold retail prices + affiliate code.

OWNED PATHS THIS LANE:
server/research/assisted-order/quote/** (extend), server/research/orders/** (your scaffold), payment-state projections over the EA manual lane (read-only consumption), focused tests; NOT the EA settlement lane internals, NOT lead seams

RESUME NOW. Checkpoint (save -> focused tests -> commit -> push -> heartbeat -> task -> handoff) every coherent slice / ~15 minutes. Your full lane prompt follows verbatim.

================================================================
# SESSION 8 — REQUEST, QUOTE, MANUAL PAYMENT, AND CANONICAL ORDER CONVERSION

## Task

Close the commercial loop after XRR creation.

## Own

Claim isolated quote/payment/order-conversion domain paths and focused admin/customer components where unowned.

Do not edit lead mount files, pricing authority, email outbox, or fulfillment implementation.

## Target

```text
XRR request
-> admin review
-> quote/current amount
-> customer acceptance
-> payment instructions
-> proof/review if used
-> authorized paid fact
-> one canonical order
```

## Quote

- durable
- exact line items
- canonical retail prices
- currency
- issue/effective/expiry
- version
- accepted/rejected
- no client-authoritative amount
- stale/changed price requires re-quote

## Manual payment

Use the approved manual lane:

```text
payment_required
instructions_presented
proof_submitted
under_review
paid
rejected
exception
refunded
```

A customer or affiliate cannot mark paid.

Proof is not payment confirmation.

Only a real provider fact or authorized named admin can mark paid.

## Canonical order

Create exactly one order with:

- customer
- request/quote lineage
- line items
- quantity
- sold retail price snapshot
- affiliate code
- shipping
- payment state
- fulfillment state
- audit history

Request remains distinct from order until conversion.

## Quantity

Support up to 100 per exact variant and verify DB/order constraints.

## Idempotency

- duplicate accept
- duplicate payment confirmation
- duplicate conversion

must not create duplicate orders.

## Tests

- stale quote
- cross-customer access
- browser total ignored
- browser paid ignored
- proof does not equal paid
- request -> order exact lineage
- affiliate code copied
- sold price immutable
- 100 accepted / 101 refused
- unpaid order cannot become fulfillment-ready
- refund/exception state

# SHARED FLEET RULES — READ BEFORE WORKING

This session is being resumed from a founder-ordered pause.

## Recover this session correctly

1. Read:
   - `AGENTS.md`
   - `CLAUDE.md`
   - `.xenios/MASTER_CORPUS.md`
   - `.xenios/FULL_VISION.md`
   - `docs/research-launch/XENIOS_RESEARCH_FULL_BUILD_STATUS_2026-08-19.md`
   - latest exact-SHA handoff/message
   - `.xenios/SESSION_REGISTRY.json`
   - `.xenios/CODE_OWNERSHIP.json`
   - `.xenios/ACTIVE_TASKS.json`

2. Run:

```bash
git fetch --all --prune --tags
git status --short --branch
git log -15 --decorate --oneline
git worktree list --porcelain
node scripts/agentic/xenios-os.mjs validate
node scripts/agentic/xenios-os.mjs status
```

3. If this is the same paused session and its worktree contains dirty work:
   - do not create a replacement worktree
   - do not reset, clean, discard, or overwrite it
   - recover the exact task and preserve the current edits
   - checkpoint the coherent portion before starting new edits

4. If this is a clean/new session:
   - use the exact current remote head of `xenios/launch-integration-20260819`, or a newer exact base published by the lead
   - do not start from `main`
   - register one session and claim one non-overlapping path lease

## One writer per path

The lead owns protected integration seams unless explicitly delegated:

```text
server/index.ts
server/research/index.ts
client/src/research/section.tsx
client/src/research/adminx-section.tsx
migration DAG / production ledger
release manifests / production packet
shared .xenios fleet state
final conflict resolution
production deploy/mutation
```

Workers provide exact-SHA handoffs and integration snippets instead of editing lead seams.

## Mandatory checkpoint loop

At least every coherent slice and approximately every 15 minutes:

1. save
2. run focused tests
3. commit coherent work
4. push
5. heartbeat
6. update task state
7. refresh exact-SHA handoff
8. message dependent lanes
9. continue

Do not accumulate thousands of uncommitted lines.

## Founder product directives

### One Early Access code

The customer-facing Early Access journey must use one code prompt:

```text
XeniosGenesis
```

Display:

```text
Xenios Genesis
```

The plaintext code must never be committed, bundled, logged, snapshotted, or stored in browser storage. Production uses a secure hash in environment secrets.

Remove only the outer/first shared Research password from the Early Access customer route/API. Do not weaken admin, member, supplier, affiliate, finance, or Care authorization.

### Full catalog and retail-only pricing

Source workbook:

```text
XENIOS_MASTER_CATALOG_AFFILIATE_PRICING_2026-08-16(4).xlsx
MASTER CATALOG -> Suggested Sell Price
```

Verified source state:

```text
426 catalog rows
424 numeric current retail prices
2 Price on request
```

The two unpriced rows are:

```text
BAM15 500 mcg
Syringes & Alcohol Swabs
```

Never show `$0`.

Customer-facing surfaces may show retail pricing only. Never expose wholesale cost, supplier quotes, multiplier, margin, markup, benchmark internals, or supplier identities.

Retail prices must resolve through Product Control / canonical server pricing, not React constants.

### Quantity

Default maximum:

```text
100 units per exact product variant
```

Reconcile UI, shared contracts, server validation, assisted orders, cart, quotes, canonical orders, database constraints/migrations, admin, and tests. Preserve lower explicit product limits only when backed by a real rule.

### Early Access commercial behavior

Anyone with the one Early Access code can enter the customer order flow without a second shared password or membership approval.

All catalog products should be visible with current retail price and a truthful action.

Do not force provider/clinical products through direct RUO ordering. Product actions remain server-authoritative:

```text
BUY_NOW
ASSISTED_ORDER
REQUEST_QUOTE
CARE
TEMPORARILY_HELD
NOT_AVAILABLE
```

### Manual affiliate code for the immediate launch

The immediate requirement is intentionally simple:

- optional affiliate code field on the Early Access order
- support manual entry and captured `?ref=` where already available
- normalize and store the code on the request/order
- show it in authorized admin views and order notification
- Samuel can manually match the code to an owner in the backend
- no automatic commission or payout is required for this phase
- affiliate code never changes price, access, payment, or order ownership

### Order emails

Every successfully persisted Early Access request/order must enqueue two idempotent notifications:

1. customer confirmation
2. Xenios admin/founder order alert

Use the existing durable outbox and configured server-side recipients. Do not hardcode private recipient addresses in client code. If email delivery fails, the request/order remains durable and the outbox retries.

Customer email contains only customer-safe retail/order information. Admin email includes the order/reference, customer contact summary, products, quantities, retail price state, affiliate code, and a secure admin link. Never include wholesale cost, margin, supplier internals, credentials, or raw sensitive documents.

Do not send real emails during development tests. Production sending is activated only through the lead's exact release packet.

## Research / Care separation

All products may be discoverable and priced, but clinical/provider-required products route through Care. Do not add dosing, medical advice, treatment, prescribing, or individualized guidance to Research surfaces.

## Production safety

Workers never:
- deploy
- apply production migrations
- change production environment
- change live pricing
- enable production flags
- send real email
- mark real payment/shipment
- create clinical facts

The lead owns release execution.

## Handoff
