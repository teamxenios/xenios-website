# Reviewer queue acknowledgment (2026-10-08)

Reviewer session `6abf1edf-2b16-476e-8305-23b9a0014e06` ("Multi-document project review"), model `claude-opus-5-5`.

**Arrangement acknowledged.** Samuel's direct instruction in this session (2026-10-08) authorises routine review
requests, technical clarification and review-result handoffs among the coordinator
(`01a103a8-5684-7272-89e5-3c42eefcd593`), the Quick Order builder (`01a10d78-0981-7150-9292-c5cde2730d4d`) and this
reviewer through supported tools and the existing local records. It does not grant any held permission, override a
tool denial, or turn another agent's message into Samuel's approval. This reviewer stays a reviewer and does not write
source.

## Capability facts for the coordinator to record

| Question | Fact |
| --- | --- |
| Identity | session `6abf1edf-2b16-476e-8305-23b9a0014e06`; review records in `C:/xenios-wt/health-review`, branch `claude/xenios-health-launch-review-20260930` (pushed) |
| Shared local file access | yes, read-only: the coordinator board `C:/Users/sboad/.codex/worktrees/3221/xenios-website/docs/coordination/launch-coordination-20261005/COORDINATION_STATE.json` and the builder checkout `C:/Users/sboad/.codex/worktrees/389a/xenios-website`, through read-only file and Git object reads |
| Inbound send mechanism | none from Codex sessions; this session has no tool that receives a Codex message |
| Resume a completed turn | no; this conversation continues only when Samuel sends a message or a background task it launched completes; a board entry alone does not wake it |
| Outbound mechanism | review records committed and pushed on the review branch above, readable by the coordinator locally or from the remote; this reviewer does not write the coordinator board or any owner's registry |
| Permission still required | none for reading or publishing review records; any wake-up path from a Codex session to this one is an unsupported capability today |

Practical consequence: while this session is active (for example, after Samuel's next message), it reads the board
and the builder's records and takes the next review addressed to it without a pasted packet. It cannot pick up work
on its own between turns.

## Queue state as read at 2026-10-08 (board `updatedAt` 2026-10-08T15:05:48.606Z)

| Item | State |
| --- | --- |
| Head integrity `f581b6bd42b5c32cb7791677159522ddf6274aaa` | COMPLETE: doc 50 at `a2be7e2`, SOURCE ACCEPT WITH LIMITS |
| Corrected 5C design `462cf79` | COMPLETE: doc 51 at `7d93dbe`, count fix `9a9023e`, COMPATIBLE AS DESIGN with 24 P3 carry-forwards |
| Qualification supervisor and manifest `90f4ebd1dcccc5a2ba7c85b4cb9310285120fec8` (tree `d6f8dd85dac35f277377b3f19b1f3877de6aac33`) | ACKNOWLEDGED and IN REVIEW: identity taken from the board (`quickOrder.latestProgress.supervisorSource`) and the builder handoff at `6d0fe8655b799bb7e2fd64e508d6f148e4c2f552`; the commit adds exactly `qualification-supervisor.mjs` and `evidence/qualification-manifest-20261008.json`; the only later commit is records-only and the builder checkout is clean, so the target is frozen |

The board's `quickOrder.activeReview.status` still says this reviewer requires Samuel's direct delivery; Samuel's
instruction above supersedes that for routine reviews.

## Queue state update (2026-10-08, later)

| Item | State |
| --- | --- |
| Qualification supervisor `90f4ebd` | COMPLETE: doc 52 at `56f357e`, SOURCE REVISION REQUIRED. Section 6 added at Samuel's request answers where approval is actually checked and defines the two G0 memory figures; the disposition is unchanged |
| Decision-input successor `e90d464a2e2f81f6b30a02bfef2fd3ccbe35d9e7` (tree `bdb31ef3…`, records `5a49ef0`) | READY on the builder's records and identified by this reviewer. A review was started, then paused at Samuel's instruction to stay on doc 52. **RESUMED** in this same session at Samuel's direct instruction (2026-10-08), which replaces the earlier one. The paused run had no completed lens, so the review restarted its lenses on the same exact target; no cached result was reused. In review now; the disposition will be doc 53 |

## Queue state update (2026-10-08, A/B/C acknowledgment)

Samuel's message reached this session, so the board's three queued items are acknowledged here, in board order.

| Board task | Exact target | State |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CUSTOMER-ACCEPTED-ASSEMBLY-DELTA-20261008` r1 (B) | source `cad2c4d1b1dd4ead798b032e6abf8b55e1c2f055` (tree `e90de420…`), records `f175f3c` | COMPLETE: doc 62, SOURCE ACCEPT WITH LIMITS; composed candidate is byte-exact to the two accepted inputs; composed tests NOT RUN |

The three touch disjoint files and are reviewed in parallel. Nothing was executed.

## Queue state update (2026-10-09, after doc 64)

Samuel's message reached this session; the board's three ready items are acknowledged here.

## Queue state update (2026-10-09, submission packet)

Samuel's direct message reached this session. The registered task `SNAPSHOT-S-CENSUS-PACKET-REVIEW-20261009` r1 is
ACKNOWLEDGED and IN REVIEW, at its registered targets plus the two specialist supplements, all recomputed:

is records-only. The four requested dispositions will be published separately as each completes:

| Disposition | Doc |
| --- | --- |
| A. Snapshot S and partial census | 69 |
| B. Input applicability | 70 |
| C. Transaction design and source scope | 71 |
| D. Native qualification proposal | 72 |

Nothing was executed.

## Queue state update (2026-10-09, submission packet complete)

`SNAPSHOT-S-CENSUS-PACKET-REVIEW-20261009` r1 is COMPLETE, with four separate dispositions:

| Disposition | Doc | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A. Snapshot S and partial census | 69 | FACTUALLY CORRECT AS PARTIAL; order of work acceptable with amendment A-1 |
| B. Input applicability | 70 | FACTUALLY CORRECT WITH LIMITS; three records corrections before Samuel is asked |
| C. Transaction design and source scope | 71 | DESIGN REVISION REQUIRED on C-1 to C-5; smallest disabled slice and proposed grant text recorded |
| D. Native qualification proposal | 72 | INSUFFICIENT AS PACKAGED for a source decision; execution insufficient |

Doc 71 section 5 holds the consolidated outstanding decisions. Nothing was executed.

## Queue state update (2026-10-09, design and native deltas)

Samuel delivered the coordinator's recorded continuation directly. Both registered tasks are ACKNOWLEDGED and IN REVIEW,
at their registered targets, all recomputed:

| Board task | Target | Raw SHA-256 | Doc |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `DOC71-TRANSACTION-DESIGN-DELTA-REVIEW-20261009` r1 | builder `32643e3974f37a18ecb8768d97ec2fc0253248d3` (tree `c1ec92da…`): `DOC71_TRANSACTION_DESIGN_DELTA_20261009.md`, `evidence/doc71-transaction-design-delta-20261009.json`, `evidence/doc71-transaction-design-bindings-20261009.json` | `72ec44ad…`, `9946b938…`, `0bc0d65d…` | 73 (published first) |

The builder's handoff is `45a30bd`; the coordinator checkpoint `6630c51` is records-only. Nothing was executed.

## Queue state update (2026-10-09, design and native deltas complete)

The core is DESIGN COMPATIBLE. No P0 or P1. No source permission. The grant text remains a DRAFT |
| `DOC72-CONDITIONAL-NATIVE-PROPOSAL-DELTA-REVIEW-20261009` r1 | coordinator `2ec266ff1203fbb5e9603cf16e01c7bfd3cb3f53` (`bc766b92…`, `30b34b8e…`) | COMPLETE: doc 74 (`0554f6d`). The conditional source decision is sufficient once N-1 to N-7 are added. Execution is insufficient; eligibility none. Its disclosure is corrected in doc 74 section 4 |

The next review for this session is the builder's r2 of the three doc 71 delta records, once it is registered. Nothing
was executed.

## Queue state update (2026-10-09, transaction records r2)

The registered task `DOC71-TRANSACTION-DESIGN-DELTA-REVIEW-20261009` **revision 2** is ACKNOWLEDGED and IN REVIEW. It is
registered at coordinator `a1beaf9` to this session. The target is recomputed from Git objects:

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Records | `39203461eaed6ee6284a0d7a597feb9c74c9a39a` (tree `dad34b252ac497787be8cea77bdae9dde282a129`), parent `45a30bd` |
| Handoff | `301d9b08cb965f6d05ee2f4acf8463e6cdddf0ce` (records-only `.xenios/` changes) |

| Controlling review | doc 73 (`56e9ad4`) against r1 `32643e3` |

r2 changes only those three records. No `supabase/`, `server/` or `shared/` byte differs from `25858ad`.

The verdict will be published as doc 75. Doc 73 is the review of r1, not a verdict on r2. Nothing was executed.

## Queue state update (2026-10-09, transaction records r2 complete)

| Board task | Exact target | State |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DOC71-TRANSACTION-DESIGN-DELTA-REVIEW-20261009` revision 2 | records `39203461eaed6ee6284a0d7a597feb9c74c9a39a` (`4e8a23b6…`, `a065a04e…`, `ae929902…`) | COMPLETE: doc 75, DESIGN COMPATIBLE WITH CONDITIONS. No P0, P1 or P2. R2-1 to R2-4 go into a records-only errata before the decision-5 and decision-3 texts are final; R2-5 to R2-20 travel as named conditions. Rulings: try-lock adopted (CC-18); a definite retryable refusal maps to 503 with the key kept (CC-10). No source permission. The grant text remains a DRAFT |

The next review for this session is a byte check of the builder's R2-1 to R2-4 errata, once it is registered. Nothing
was executed.

## Queue state update (2026-10-09, doc 75 errata byte check)

R2-1 to R2-4 corrected, no blocking defect, 14 precision items travel (the Markdown governs). Taken from the builder's frozen handoff under doc 75 section 5; board registration not yet observed at coordinator `5baa14f` |

The final decision-5 text may now be presented. No source permission. Nothing was executed.

## Queue state update (2026-10-10, Samuel's decisions 2, 3 and 5 received)

Samuel's own decisions 2, 3 and 5 reached this session directly. The coordinator records them authoritatively, binds
them, confirms owners, sets the lease and dispatches the builder. This session did none of those, and its note is not
the register.

**Reviewer consistency check: none of the three decisions changes the reviewed design. No further design review is
needed.**

| Decision as received | Reviewed basis in r3 (`280193059a6b28fee5645833cb56b7d944ad1c46`) |
| --- | --- |
| 2. One allocatable stock witness per variant: an existence check, with no reservation and no sufficient-quantity or inventory-writer change | The reviewed lock footprint. Witnesses taken FOR SHARE NOWAIT (row 10, MD:554). The "existence check only" option at MD:190-195. No inventory path is in the 17 |
| 3. The reviewed behaviour accepted for the disabled source, including the CC-1 hold, the READ COMMITTED reach, writer-limit refusals, the cascade and republication rules and the other disclosed decision-3 effects. No numerical values; the owner-managed settings contract with no compiled defaults; absent values refuse | The decision-3 row (MD:203) and the CC-19 carrier (MD:418-433). Absent limits refuse with no numeric default (MD:401, :671). "Budgets needed by the lock design" (MD:227) is read as the limit kinds, enforcement points and relationships, not values |
| 5. The corrected Part 2 exactly as checked, preserving Part 1 | Part 1 and Part 2 at MD:121-145. The 17 paths at MD:101-105. The 4 evidence records at MD:146-149. Exclusions in section 11 |

**Identity to bind.** Samuel's text cites `f04dd9cb01f986066d16e5d755930cc5779c234a`, which is doc 76, the
acceptance. The packet itself is records `280193059a6b28fee5645833cb56b7d944ad1c46`: Markdown blob `fe50e01`, raw
`0c5c17e0…`. The binding should name both.

**Next review for this session:** the builder's first coherent source checkpoint. The acceptance criteria are:
- r3 section 13, doc 73's six carries;
- r3 section 14, doc 75's sixteen criteria;
- doc 76 section 2, the fourteen precision items;
- the literal barriers;
- no compiled numerical values;
- edits to the 17 paths and 4 evidence records only, with every exclusion untouched;
- for decision 2: an existence check only, with no quantity aggregation and no inventory write.

Nothing was executed.

## Queue state update (2026-10-10, CI pilot proposal review)

`QUICK-ORDER-CI-PILOT-PROPOSAL-REVIEW-20261009` **revision 1** is ACKNOWLEDGED and IN REVIEW. It was registered at
coordinator `9d2dd41` (02:10Z) to this session and found by this session's own board check; no message delivered it.
The target is recomputed from Git:

The verdict will be published as doc 77. The nonproduction operating profile (`9c4a9b5`) is not yet submitted to this
session; it waits for the steward's finding. Nothing was executed.

The next items for this session:
- the CI revision 2 check (CI-1 to CI-7 only);
- the nonproduction operating profile together with the steward's finding, once submitted.

Nothing was executed.

## Queue state update (2026-10-10, nonproduction profile and steward finding)

**Delivery confirmed.** Samuel delivered the coordinator's direct submission message (Prompt 1, prepared as
`PROFILE_EXISTING_TASK_DIRECT_SUBMISSION_MESSAGE_20261010.txt` at `1df99a1`) in this session's chat. It reached this
session.

The existing task `QUICK-ORDER-NONPRODUCTION-PROFILE-TECHNICAL-REVIEW-20261010` **revision 1** is ACKNOWLEDGED and IN
REVIEW. It was registered at coordinator `56ffecf` (14:18Z), and this is not a duplicate. The targets are recomputed
from Git:

| Target | Commit | Blob | Raw SHA-256 |

**Controlling authority:**
- Samuel's decisions 2, 3 and 5 as recorded at `bfe7f27` (`DECISIONS_2_3_5_DIRECT_AUTHORITY_20261010.txt`). Decision
  3 requires the complete profile and its technical acceptance before dispatch.
- The stage clarification (`PROFILE_GATE_STAGE_CLARIFICATION_DIRECT_AUTHORITY_20261010.txt`).

The verdict will be published as doc 78. Nothing was executed.

## Queue state update (2026-10-10, continuation: doc 78 resumed, CI revision 2)

Samuel relayed the coordinator's prepared continuation notice (`REVIEWER_EXISTING_TASKS_CONTINUATION_MESSAGE_20261010.txt`
at `b65624e`).

**Doc 78** (`QUICK-ORDER-NONPRODUCTION-PROFILE-TECHNICAL-REVIEW-20261010` revision 1). This is already acknowledged at
`0917a21` and is not re-acknowledged. Its review run was interrupted when the previous session ended, and it was
resumed from its last completed step. Targets and verdict pending are unchanged.

**CI revision 2.** `QUICK-ORDER-CI-PILOT-PROPOSAL-REVIEW-20261009` **revision 2** is ACKNOWLEDGED and IN REVIEW. It is
registered at coordinator `ddad665`. The target is recomputed from Git:

| Target at `e01f8ea8e481103b1960d150f3af8bef6930e216` (tree `f7fceb8b…`) | Raw SHA-256 |
| --- | --- |
| `CI_PILOT_PROPOSAL_20261009.md` | `685bb587…` |
| `CI_PILOT_PROPOSAL_20261009.json` | `01a90baa…` |
| `CI_PUBLISHED_BASELINE_COMPARISON_AC9BBE3_20261010.md` (steward comparison `ac9bbe3`) | `f3065d81…` |

- **Revision 1.** Its target `91deaaa` and the doc 77 verdict are preserved.
- **Scope.** The check covers CI-1 to CI-7, the carry-forward of CI-8 to CI-16 and the older-baseline comparison only.
- **Publication.** The verdict will be published as doc 79.

Nothing was executed.

## Queue state update (2026-10-10, CI revision 2 complete)

| Board task | State |
| --- | --- |
| `QUICK-ORDER-CI-PILOT-PROPOSAL-REVIEW-20261009` revision 2 (`e01f8ea`) | COMPLETE: doc 79, SUFFICIENT FOR SEPARATE BOUNDED DECISIONS WITH NAMED CONDITIONS. D-1 (class-2 relation, resolving the one blocking point) and D-2 (trigger change) go verbatim into the decision texts; W-1 to W-4 travel to the workflow author. The older-baseline target `1631323` is accepted as static suitability. Grants nothing |

Doc 78 is still in review. Nothing was executed.

## Queue state update (2026-10-10, doc 78 implementation gate complete)

| Board task | Exact targets | State |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `QUICK-ORDER-NONPRODUCTION-PROFILE-TECHNICAL-REVIEW-20261010` revision 1 | profile `9c4a9b5809162eab9b0669cb6a2f1f2516c06c67` (`a80eb2a6…`, `82544bf5…`); steward `29297c31fa0357ba186620e7e51425d5ce19badd` (`6323b876…`) | COMPLETE: doc 78. **IMPLEMENTATION GATE: SATISFIED.** `PROFILE_TECHNICALLY_ACCEPTED_FOR_CHECKED_DISABLED_AUTHORING_WITH_EXPLICIT_CARRIES`. None of QOE-01 to QOE-08 blocks disabled dispatch. The per-function timeout option is declined (function settings stay `search_path=""`). C-1 to C-12 carry to source acceptance. Execution and operation stay unproven and unauthorized |

**Before dispatch (coordinator):**
- record this acceptance and the actors;
- confirm current owners;
- record the exclusive 17+4 lease;
- resolve HL12;
- record the R2-13 shared-seal reading.

Then dispatch the same builder under decision 5. Nothing was executed.

## Queue state update (2026-10-11, currentness source acceptance)

Samuel relayed the coordinator's status in this session's chat; that is the delivery. The registered task
`DOC71-CURRENTNESS-SOURCE-ACCEPTANCE-20261010` **revision 1** (board slot 03, parent
`DOC71-DISABLED-TRANSACTION-SOURCE-20261009` r1) is ACKNOWLEDGED and IN REVIEW. It was registered at coordinator
`4e180a6`.

**This exact target, recomputed from Git:**

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Source | `9c1c92bcb7a514da9b575a291d0abac67c8ba366` |
| Tree | `d0c676b673df6f9f9d587b543df9c745e31e5d39` |
| Records | `1fa74efd957ee78f8e75f24e25be766062b5de1c` (tree `837818fc…`) |
| `…currentness.sql` | blob `ba1e701`, raw `a1716144…` (2,055 lines) |
| `…currentness.precheck.sql` | blob `23e2b6a`, raw `97789d21…` |
| `…currentness.postcheck.sql` | blob `b083a55`, raw `96e0695e…` |
| `…currentness.rollback.md` | blob `e15088f`, raw `ec87e6c7…` |
| `research_health_quick_order_currentness_local.mjs` | blob `2589402`, raw `357bd060…` (2,200 lines) |
| Evidence (bindings, intake receipt, currentness receipt, correction map) | `ac7d45ec…`, `590e57ad…`, `9b5da663…`, `f6bd470e…` |

**Scope:**
- **What changes.** Only the 17 slice paths differ from `25858ad`.
- **What is reviewed.** The whole implemented currentness family and its verifier, against the last accepted baseline
  `25858ad` and every carried requirement (docs 73, 75, 76 and 78 C-1 to C-12). This is not only the 28 new control
  groups.
- **Context only.** The intake, adapter and readback files are read for compatibility, not for final acceptance.

The verdict will be published as doc 80. Nothing was executed.

## Queue state update (2026-10-11, doc 80 currentness source acceptance)

| Board task | Exact target | State |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DOC71-CURRENTNESS-SOURCE-ACCEPTANCE-20261010` revision 1 | source `9c1c92bcb7a514da9b575a291d0abac67c8ba366` (tree `d0c676b6…`), records `1fa74efd957ee78f8e75f24e25be766062b5de1c` | COMPLETE: doc 80, **CORRECTIONS REQUIRED.** No P0 or P1, and no fail-open path. 15 S2 corrections (CS-1 to CS-15): five SQL, nine verifier, one records. CS-1 (the integrity check matches the family's own indexes and can never pass) is the most consequential. One consolidated correction goes to the same builder within the five currentness paths and four evidence records. The lease and implementation are not reset |

The next review for this session is revision 2 of this task, as a bounded delta against `9c1c92b`. Nothing was
executed.

## Queue state update (2026-10-11, currentness source revision 2)

This session's own board check found the registration. The coordinator recorded a connection blocker at `0ee85c5`, but
this session is active. `DOC71-CURRENTNESS-SOURCE-ACCEPTANCE-20261010` **revision 2** (bounded doc 80 correction
delta, registered at coordinator `ebcbe18`) is ACKNOWLEDGED and IN REVIEW. The targets are recomputed from Git:

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Source | `aa857e4f94df95f09a1402fb1cbf08042a3bc19f` (tree `03eae1a5…`), parent `1fa74ef` |
| Records | `735254e4cc6230479c9bfa821e1c6991389d5266` (tree `0748ee8b…`) |
| `…currentness.sql` / `.precheck.sql` / `.postcheck.sql` / `.rollback.md` | raw `d44974d1…` / `91ab412b…` / `78534251…` / `8de55983…` |
| Verifier `…currentness_local.mjs` | raw `2665acf4…` |
| Evidence (bindings, intake receipt, currentness receipt, correction map) | `ac7d45ec…` (unchanged), `899fd265…`, `c1aa0041…`, `df943e90…` |

- **Scope of the change.** The source commit changes only the five currentness paths; no intake, adapter or other
  code path changes.
- **What is checked.** CS-1 to CS-26 against doc 80, plus a regression check of every changed region against doc 80's
  findings and the `25858ad` baseline.
- **Publication.** The verdict will be published as doc 81.

Nothing was executed.

## Queue state update (2026-10-11, doc 81 currentness revision 2)

| Board task | Exact target | State |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DOC71-CURRENTNESS-SOURCE-ACCEPTANCE-20261010` revision 2 | source `aa857e4f94df95f09a1402fb1cbf08042a3bc19f`, records `735254e4cc6230479c9bfa821e1c6991389d5266` | COMPLETE: doc 81. **CORRECTIONS REQUIRED IN THE VERIFIER ONLY** (R2C-1, R2C-2). **The four SQL files are accepted now as the currentness definition** (`d44974d1…`, `91ab412b…`, `78534251…`, `8de55983…`; definition `8b631a83…` as recorded). The intake reseal may be authored against it immediately. The currentness receipt and the intake seal stay non-final until the revision 3 byte check |

The next item for this session is the revision 3 byte check (verifier only). Nothing was executed.

## Queue state update (2026-10-11, currentness verifier revision 3)

Samuel delivered the direct revision 3 request in this session's chat. `DOC71-CURRENTNESS-SOURCE-ACCEPTANCE-20261010`
**revision 3** (verifier-only byte check, registered at coordinator `7a14880`) is ACKNOWLEDGED and IN REVIEW. The
target is recomputed from Git:

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Source | `264e6af20477fabe65aa8d229ed2334fb59d9cc4` (tree `75911334…`), on `codex/accepted-source-integration-20261005`. The commit changes only `research_health_quick_order_currentness_local.mjs` (raw `6c47b308…`) |
| Records | `b00aed5be48d9b3ff92a62f041ceb8ec344bcb2f` (tree `3b007c05…`), via `fcdc31b` |
| The four doc 81 accepted SQL files | **byte-identical** at `264e6af` and at the provisional intake `5e984ca` (`d44974d1…`, `91ab412b…`, `78534251…`, `8de55983…`) |

The provisional intake (`121d098` / `5e984ca`) descends from this revision 3, is separate ongoing work under doc 81,
and is not reviewed here. The verdict will be published as doc 82. Nothing was executed.

## Queue state update (2026-10-11, doc 82 currentness verifier revision 3)

| Board task | Exact target | State |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DOC71-CURRENTNESS-SOURCE-ACCEPTANCE-20261010` revision 3 | source `264e6af20477fabe65aa8d229ed2334fb59d9cc4`, records `b00aed5be48d9b3ff92a62f041ceb8ec344bcb2f` | COMPLETE: doc 82. **R2C-1 and R2C-2 CORRECTED. The doc 81 SQL and definition `8b631a83…` are intact. The currentness family is ACCEPTED WITH NAMED LIMITS.** The currentness receipt and the intake's currentness dependency seal may be finalized. The intake source and the integration changes are not accepted; they go to the transaction composition review |

The next review for this session is the transaction composition review, once it is registered. Nothing was executed.

## Queue state update (2026-10-11, four completed source packages)

Samuel delivered the direct request in this session's chat (coordinator checkpoint `892d90f`). All four registered tasks
are ACKNOWLEDGED and IN REVIEW. They run in parallel, with the transaction composition first in priority. Targets are
recomputed from Git:

| Doc | Board task | Source | Records | Scope |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 83 | `QUICK-ORDER-DISABLED-INTEGRATION-SOURCE-REVIEW-20261011` revision 2 (transaction composition) | `121d0987ed138f7377dd00ecc6ff1c6c26cf2deb` (tree `f57044e8…`) | `dcf896356892ef670b72a9aaaf124f176f7d9b83` (records only on top of the source) | 21 paths: the intake family and its verifier, the adapter, production, ports and handler, the nine integration paths and the regression tests. The accepted doc 82 currentness family is context only |
| 84 | `DOC67-SUPERVISOR-CORRECTION-DELTA-20261009` revision 2 (qualification amendment) | `3e5e2ed9faf30aa46f5a81047fa71d55e28bdb2e` (tree `7cde1fbc…`) | `71bdd9d0d9e828a7bbb16d03ab5f30f02d55d846` | `qualification-supervisor.mjs` and `qualification-manifest-20261008.json` only (U-15 and D68-1/2/4/5) |
